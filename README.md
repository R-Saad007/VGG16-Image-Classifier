# Personalized VGG16 Image Classifier model for PyTorch Framework

### Run driver.py to train the model for a user-defined number of epochs.
```python driver.py```
### Run inference.py to run inference for images added in the inference_images/images/ directory.
``` python inference.py```
### The model is trained using CIFAR-10 dataset, hence can be used to classify the following 10 classes:
- airplane
- automobile
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse
- ship
- truck
